## What

jtmpl is an extensible, modular, functional-reactive DOM templating engine.
It makes complex GUI development fun and productive.
It's simple conceptually and can be [grasped quickly](examples).


## Features


* Familiar [Mustache syntax](https://mustache.github.io/mustache.5.html).

* Automatic, context-based, bi-directional data-binding.
No need to touch the DOM: it's the result of your template + current model state.

* 100% declarative, zero boilerplate.

* Plain JavaScript object model, CommonJS modules support.

* Dynamic partials, requests, distributed applications.

* Computed properties, automatic dependency tracking.

* Plugin support, batteries included:

  * Event handling

  * Routes _(coming soon)_

  * Validators _(coming soon)_

* Predictable, plays nice with others: generated DOM is stable and only necessary parts
are updated synchronously with model updates.

* Lightweight, only 6KB min&gz.
